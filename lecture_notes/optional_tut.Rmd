knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Coding Standards

- Always use text files/text editor (because it can be read by almost any editing programm)
- Indent your code (for readability purposes mostly)
- Limit the width of your code
- Limit the length of indivivual functions (more readable and easier to debug)
